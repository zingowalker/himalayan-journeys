Prioritizing Trekker Health: Acclimatization Guidelines for Zanskar River Trek
In light of the health challenges posed by Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), 
the Ladakh Government Authorities have instituted new regulations for Zanskar river trekkers. 
It is now mandatory for all participants to spend a minimum of two days in Leh, allowing their bodies to 
fully acclimatize to the prevailing weather conditions.

This crucial measure is non-negotiable and demands strict adherence from every trekker. 
Utilize the time in Leh wisely by exploring the local market and acclimating to the cold temperatures, 
a crucial preparation for the Zanskar river trek. 
The weather, reaching sub-zero even during daylight, necessitates gradual adjustment.

Exercise caution by avoiding visits to higher-altitude places during this acclimatization period. 
Additionally, it is strongly recommended to meticulously check and crosscheck all essential items before retiring for the night, 
ensuring a safe and prepared start to your Zanskar river trekking adventure.
