Today you will drive approx 3 hours to Skyu following the Zanskar river. On reaching Skyu you will meet the trek team, a quick hello and you will start trekking to Markha. You'll be following the Markha River and gradually gaining altitude. As you trek, you'll pass through lush green meadows and see the rugged landscape that characterizes this region. 

Along the way, you'll come across the quaint and scenic Umlung village. Take a break to explore this traditional Ladakhi village, interact with the friendly locals, and witness their way of life. Admire the picturesque houses, prayer flags, and the tranquil ambiance of Umlung. It's an opportunity to connect with the cultural richness of the region. 

Continue your journey, and after a few hours of trekking, you'll reach the iconic Markha village. Markha is one of the most renowned and culturally significant villages in the region. 

Explore the village, which is nestled in a beautiful valley surrounded by Rocky Mountains. Visit the Markha Monastery and immerse yourself in the spiritual and serene atmosphere. Interact with the welcoming locals, and if the season is right, you might get the chance to participate in local festivals or witness traditional ceremonies.

Camp overnight in Markha village. The campsite in Markha offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and the Markha Valley. Enjoy a delicious meal prepared by your support staff and share stories with fellow trekkers around a delicious meal.

Today marks the start of the trek's most breathtaking segment. The upper Markha valley unfolds before you, revealing amazing view of Kang Yatse, a near-perfect pyramid-shaped peak.

Walk on the path ascending from Markha village, tracing the trail alongside the Markha River. Despite encountering a wooden plank bridge, continue walking alongside the river's right bank.

Approximately 2 kilometers later, you'll ford the Markha River, requiring at least two crossings today. Following the second crossing, a two-hour ascent leads to Umlung, a quaint settlement. Keep an eye out for the Umlung Gompa and navigate your way from its base to reach Umlung.
> Distance & Time taken: 11Kms / 4-5Hrs trek / Elevation gain / loss: +305m / -35m

#### Day 3 - Hankar to Nimaling

Today offers another day of trekking amidst stunning landscapes. Take your time to savor the views, but ensure an early arrival at Nimaling before any potential weather changes.

Follow the trail from Hankar as it ascends steeply. Roughly 1 kilometer ahead, the path bifurcates. Disregard the ascending trail leading to Zalung Karpo La pass. Instead, follow the lower path; after an additional 1 kilometer, you'll arrive at the Thachungtse campsite.

Thachuntse have charming green fields along with a couple of teahouse tents. Beyond Thachungtse, the trail forks. Opt for the left trail; the right one leads to Kang Yatse base camp.

Initially, the path maintains its steepness for about an hour before transitioning into a more gradual ascent. Eventually, you'll come across a picturesque pond, Kang Yatse looming in the background. It's an ideal spot to relish your packed lunch.

From the pond, the path eases into a lengthy but gentle descent leading to the breezy plateau of Nimaling. Despite its altitude, Nimaling surprisingly boasts lush greenery, serving as a summer pasture. During the trekking season (May to September), a tea house is available, offering numerous pre-set tents for a comfortable overnight stay.
> Distance & Time taken: 10.8Kms / 6-7Hrs trek / Elevation gain / loss: +836m / -25m

#### Day 4 - Nimaling – Kongmaru La – Chokdo

Today's trek poses some challenges. First, you'll tackle a short yet steep ascent to  Kongmaru La. However, the real test comes with the almost unending steep descent from the pass.

From Nimaling, Kongmaru La stands distinctly visible to the east. Cross the stream near the campsite and head towards the pass. There's a clear trail that ascends steeply, taking about 2 hours from Nimaling to reach the pass.

Kongmaru La serves as a great resting point after the demanding climb. On clear days, the view from here offers a spectacular panorama of the Indus valley and the Ladakh ranges.

However, this marks the beginning of the truly challenging part of the day. The descent from the pass is rugged, with rocky terrain and a steep drop as you venture into a narrow canyon after trekking down 2 to 3 km.

After about 2 hours of descent, the canyon widens upon reaching Sukarmo. This place offers tea house tents, making it another possible stop for the night. Continuing for another hour along the river bed, the trail runs alongside a small hill, consistently descending.

Finally, you'll arrive at Chokdo, a small village and pick up point to drive back to Leh.
