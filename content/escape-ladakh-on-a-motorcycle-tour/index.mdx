Morning transfer to New Delhi Railway Station to board train for Kalka.
Upon arrival in Kalka, drive to Shimla.

The one-time summer capital of the British, Shimla is a gorgeous hill station in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The destination is unique with its unparalleled glittering beauty. It is set in the midst of impressive hills and dense jungles. Shimla is also the kick off point for the adventure enthusiasts who love to explore the Himalayas. 

The snow-capped mountains, quaint surroundings and the mighty formations of Victorian style that dot the city, reverberates the colonial texture of the city. The awesome British populations of the yester years make Christmas a fanfare of the valley.Upon arrival in Shimla, transfer to hotel.

Later take possession of the Royal Enfield bikes and the enthusiastic ones can drive around the town. Royal Enfield is the best bike to ride in the weather and terrain of the Himalayas.

#### Day 3 - Shimla to Saharan
The first day of our Himalayan motorcycle tour is an absolute delight! Exiting the bustling chaos of Shimla, we swiftly transition onto exquisitely paved winding roads, a sheer pleasure to ride! Descending 1300 meters, we reach a river valley, offering a delightful lunch spot at an air-conditioned restaurant (perfect for the valley's heat!).

Tracing the river upstream leads us to Sarahan, the gateway to the Kinnaur region. The road clings to colossal cliffs, featuring dramatic overhangs and rock tunnels. As the twisting road skirts the edge of a deep valley, it's akin to those jaw-dropping roads seen on YouTube—except now, you're right amidst this stunning landscape!

Before dinner, unwind and explore. Whether it's a visit to the intricately adorned Bhimakali Temple, browsing through bustling village shops, or indulging in the local barbers' unique head and face massage experience—there's plenty of time for relaxation and discovery.

Descending back into the valley, we trace the roaring river's path until we reach the expansive hydroelectric dam at Karcham. Departing from the main road, we embark on an exhilarating ascent up the valley's edge, leading us to our lunch halt at Sangla. Indulging in a scrumptious meal of Tibetan mo-mos and noodles, we later retrace our route down the winding hairpin bends, descending to the valley floor, and continue along the Sutlej River towards Kalpa.

Ascending once more to reach the Kinner Villa Hotel rewards us with breathtaking vistas. Following dinner, the hotel's terrace comes alive with the warmth of an altar fire—an ideal way to cap off the day!

Kalpa offers an ideal setting for a rest day, surrounded by such picturesque landscapes. It's also an opportune moment to venture into town and manage the necessary permits for our upcoming entry into the Spiti Valley.

The views across the valley from the hotel are breath-taking, with the sacred peak of Kinnaur Kailash piercing the skyline at 4,650m. A walk around the hills surrounding the hotel is a rewarding way to spend your time before resuming the riding the following day.

#### Day 6 - Kalpa to Nako
Rested and full of energy, we'll hit the road bright and early for the next leg of our journey. Riding alongside the river for a stretch, we'll head through the border checkpoint to secure those vital permits before embarking on a continuous climb. Our ascent doesn't halt until we reach an astonishing altitude of 3,600 meters above sea level, where the air is crisp and pure, provided you're not trailing an Indian truck!

The ubiquitous wandering cows, a familiar sight until now, give way to ambling donkeys and goats, prompting us to keep our gaze ahead while soaking in the breathtaking scenery. Our destination: the captivating village of Nako—a verdant oasis nestled in an otherwise arid landscape. Time seems to stand still in this place, with narrow streets bordered by ancient homes where livestock reside beneath family dwellings. Bright-eyed children frolic in the labyrinthine lanes that crisscross the village.

For our stay, spacious safari-style tents await us. Following dinner in the inviting clubhouse, we'll gather around the crackling fire pit under a vast canopy of star-studded sky.


#### Day 7 - Nako to Komic - Kaza

Leaving the village, we climb briefly before descending through winding bends to the valley below.

En route, we pass by beehives lining the roads and venture through breathtaking landscapes until we reach Tabo. Here stands India's oldest recorded monastery, over 1000 years old—an awe-inspiring structure that's a must-see!

Continuing along the river, we approach an expansive flood plain, the water stretching almost half a mile wide at times. Our destination, Kaza at 3700m, awaits—a village blanketed in snow during winter.

Arriving at our hotel for lunch, the day's ride isn't over yet. While you're welcome to relax or explore the charming streets, our planned afternoon ride is a real treat.

We'll embark on a loop to Komic, the world's highest motorable village, perhaps even a visit to the highest Post Office if time allows. The ascent offers stunning views as we navigate up the valley walls, reaching high plains adorned with quaint homes and traditional buckthorn roofs. Look out for fascinating fossils; local kids might offer them as souvenirs, their infectious smiles hard to resist for just a few rupees.

At Komic, a stop for refreshments marks our visit to the highest motorable village. On our descent, a different route unveils a colossal Buddha statue overseeing the valley—perfect for a selfie session.

#### Day 8 - Kaza to Keylong
This day promises to be unforgettable! We depart early from Kaza, crossing the Spiti river and journeying west for the ultimate highlight. After a checkpoint, we embark on an astounding ascent through a breathtaking valley. With altitude rise, temperatures fall, yet the scenery keeps getting more spectacular.

At the pass's peak, a vast Buddhist shrine awaits, possibly accompanied by Yaks for some great selfies! Descending swiftly, we enjoy a fulfilling lunch at a cozy stone café on the valley floor. But wait, the day's superlatives continue! In the afternoon, our route meanders beside the river, featuring water splashes, boulder fields, and even rivers as part of the road. Climbing again through a valley reminiscent of Middle-earth from Lord of the Rings, reaching the main road assures you've experienced something truly extraordinary.
