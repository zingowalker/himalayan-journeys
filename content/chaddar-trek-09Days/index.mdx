Today, you'll drive west of Ladakh along the road to Kargil and Srinagar, following the Indus River. You'll pass through the small town of Nimmu, an important place in Ladakh where the Zanskar River joins the Indus. After a little over an hour, you'll head north on a road leading to Likir, one of Ladakh's well-known Buddhist monasteries. This is known as snow leopard territory. The landscape here is vast and wide, and as you turn onto a dirt road, you'll start ascending a narrow valley alongside a stream called the Ulley Chhu. The guides are always on the lookout, scanning the hillsides and the horizon for any shapes. This area is perfect for spotting Ibex, and there's nothing quite like seeing a majestic male Ibex perched on a narrow ledge, thousands of feet above a steep drop.

You'll be staying at the Snow Leopard Lodge in Ulley, which offers six separate bedrooms in a low stone-built building. There's also a dining room and kitchen in the same building. What makes this experience even more special is that you'll be living with a Ladakhi family during the winter, allowing you to understand their way of life. Sharing their large, warm kitchens filled with brass, copper, and silver ornaments is a unique cultural experience.

#### Day - 10 Ulley to Leh
This morning, following breakfast, we bid farewell to our gracious hosts and embark on the return journey to Leh town. Along the way, we make a stop at the Alchi Monastery. Alchi Gompa is situated near the charming village of Saspol and is one of Ladakh's earliest monastic establishments, dating back to the 11th century. What sets Alchi apart is that it was constructed before the turbulent wars of the 15th century, and as a protective measure, it was built on lowlands rather than atop a hill, which was the customary location for monasteries during that time to safeguard them from invading armies.

After our enlightening visit, we resume our journey back to Leh. 
You will spend one night at the Mahey Retreat in a comfortable Deluxe Room with private facilities, and your stay includes meals.
