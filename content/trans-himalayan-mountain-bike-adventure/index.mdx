## Detail Itinerary

#### Day 1 - Arrive Manali (1,951m)
Today you arrive Manali and check into hotel, Spend the day at leisure and int the evening there will be a briefing session. Our expedition leader shares crucial safety tips and health guidelines for our upcoming journey to Ladakh. We're introduced to our mountain bikes and given a quick rundown before a test ride.
Ensuring our comfort on the bikes is key, so if there are any adjustments needed, we notify the leader. Once confident with our bikes, the leader outlines our route and daily plan for a clear understanding of the journey.

After a satisfying meal and a good night's sleep, we're all set for an unforgettable adventure!

#### Day 2 - Manali to Marhi (3,360m)
Starting the expedition off around 9 A.M. after breakfast, we head towards Ladakh, starting with a 37.5 km ride to Marhi—a small village near Rohtang Pass. The journey is tough, all uphill, demanding thorough preparation. Rain covers and gear for possible showers are essential.
Climbing through forests, we're treated to breathtaking views—towns below, the majestic Himalayas, and seasonal waterfalls from recent rain or melting snow. The vivid scenery, with lush greens, deep blues of the sky, and foaming white waterfalls, is truly mesmerizing.
Considering the altitude gained, staying hydrated and well-fed is crucial for acclimatization. By evening, we reach Marhi, where tents are set, and hot snacks await. It's a time to rest and connect with fellow riders before facing tomorrow's challenge.
> Distance: 37.5 km Duration: 8-9 hours

#### Day 3 - Marhi (3,360m) to Sissu (3,130m) via Rohtang La (3,978m)
Today marks our first major challenge—a mountain pass! We start with a 16 km uphill ride from Marhi to Rohtang Pass (3,980m), followed by a 23 km downhill stretch to a village for lunch. Then, a gradual 12 km with some ups and downs takes us to Sissu.
Though comparatively easier with a long downhill stretch and gradual parts, the initial climb to Rohtang Pass demands effort due to the altitude. Thinner air makes physical activity challenging.
As we ascend, the landscape changes from greenery to dry mountains. At Rohtang Pass, we pause for panoramic views of distant snow-capped peaks, a reminder of our journey. The thrilling downhill ride is quick but requires control to navigate bends safely.
After lunch near Koksar, the descent ends, and we continue to Sissu, nestled in the Lahaul and Spiti district. By late afternoon, we arrive at our stay for the night—Swiss tents with cozy beds and blankets to keep us warm after a long day's ride.
> Distance: 51 km Duration: 6-7 hours

#### Day 4 - Sissu (3,130m) to Jispa (3,200m)
Covering 55 km in 6-7 hours, today's ride takes us from Sissu to Jispa, an adventure worth leaving the cozy blankets for! Passing through Keylong, the journey starts easy, with gradual ups and downs for the initial 10 km, followed by a 15 km downhill stretch.
The landscape transforms into a dry terrain, a sign we're entering the cold desert region. The remainder of the route is mostly uphill, challenging under the sun. Staying hydrated and taking breaks for snacks is essential to keep up energy.
Passing through Keylong, we catch sight of the majestic Mt. Lady of Keylong, a towering 6000M peak favored by mountaineers.
Arriving in Jispa by 3 PM, we settle in a local homestay with comfy beds, blankets, attached bathrooms, and hot water. Evening brings hot snacks, relaxation, and a chance to appreciate the scenery while giving our tired legs a break.
> Distance: 55 km Duration: 6-7 hours

#### Day 5 - Jispa (3,200m) to Zingzingbar (4,270m)
Refreshed from a restful night and a hearty breakfast, we set out for Zinzingbar, expecting an exhilarating yet physically demanding day. A significant part of our journey involves an uphill climb, some sections steep and others more gradual. The toughest part, a 6 km ascent to upper Zingzingbar for our night camp, tests our endurance, especially at higher altitudes under the blazing sun. Staying hydrated and finding a comfortable pace is crucial for a smoother ride.
Passing through Darcha, a small town with a checkpost and local eateries, we continue along the Manali-Leh highway toward Deepak Tal, a stunning blue lake amidst dusty mountains. Here, we take a break before proceeding to Zingzingbar, the road tracing the Bhaga river through an increasingly arid landscape. On clear days, the sky appears a deep blue, cloudless as if untouched by paint.
Lunch at lower Zingzingbar prepares us for the final ascent of the day. By around 5 PM, we reach upper Zingzingbar, indulging in hot snacks and settling into tents for the night. Tomorrow awaits the thrilling ride to our second high mountain pass in this expedition!
> Distance: 36 kms Duration: 7-8 hours

#### Day 6 - Zingzingbar (4,270m) to Sarchu (4,290m) via Baralacha La (4,850m)
Today we will be  heading to Baralacha La, the second high mountain pass at a towering 4,850m! Our journey from upper Zingzingbar to Baralacha La spans a challenging 16 km ascent on our mountain bikes. From the pass, an adventurous downhill ride through rugged terrain and streams leads us to Sarchu. The roads today vary from well-laid to under construction, making downhill cycling on gravel-filled offroads quite demanding. Maintaining balance is crucial in these conditions.

Cycling towards Baralacha La offers breathtaking mountain views, reminding us of the distance covered and yet to come. The vistas from Baralacha La are stunning, with Suraj Tal, a Himalayan lake, and its reflections adding to the beauty. Even within the arid landscapes, the textures, colors, and shapes of the mountains change as we progress. Riding through this vast open landscape towards Sarchu is an indescribable feeling, surrounded by massive mountain ranges.

Arriving at Sarchu around 4 PM, we settle into Swiss tents, once again greeted by cozy beds and blankets. Rest well, for tomorrow, we venture further into Ladakh.
> Distance: 50 kms Duration: 7-8 hours

#### Day 7 - Sarchu (4,290m) to Whisky Nala via Nakee La (4,769m)
Today promises a blend of thrills and challenges! Departing from Sarchu, we venture into Ladakh, conquering the Gata Loops and ascending the Nakee La, our third high mountain pass, before reaching Whisky Nala. The initial 22 km from Sarchu to the start of Gata Loops offers a relatively flat ride with some descent and occasional ascents. The real challenge begins with a strenuous uphill climb through the 21 Gata Loops, leading us to Nakee La at 4738m. The descent from Nakee La to Whisky Nala is more gradual.

Climbing to Nakee La demands rhythm and stamina due to the steep gradient and altitude. Crossing two checkposts, we officially enter Ladakh shortly after leaving Sarchu, surrounded by stunning scenery and clear blue skies. Passing through Gata Loops requires caution due to narrow roads and truck traffic. Keep an eye out for blue sheep herds along the way!

Arriving at Whisky Nala by 4 PM, we're greeted with tents and hot snacks. At this altitude of 4,600m, altitude-related concerns like Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) may arise due to inadequate acclimatization or dehydration. Staying hydrated with 5-6 liters of water daily is crucial. Inform the expedition leader promptly if any discomfort arises. Rest well to aid muscle recovery.
> Distance: 48 kms Duration: 7-8 hours

#### Day 8 - Whisky Nala to Debring (4,835m) via Lachung La (5,059m)
The route to Debring covers 81 km in a single day, starting with a 7 km ascent to Lachung La followed by a descent to Pang, a small settlement offering beds and food. From Pang, a brief 5 km climb leads to the beginning of More Plains—a thrilling 45 km flat stretch offering stunning scenery. The road maintains a consistent gradient until Debring, with a slight ascent before reaching the campsite. Despite the challenge of the distance and strong winds on More Plains, it's an exhilarating day.

The journey to Lachung La involves offroading, with unpaved roads until More Plains. However, the captivating landscape compensates for the rough terrain, making the ride exciting. Traveling through More Plains offers smooth roads and expansive vistas, revealing the vast 'cold desert' landscape.

By 5 PM, we arrive at Debring, longing for well-deserved rest after a taxing day. Enjoy hearty meals and a night's rest to recharge.
> Distance: 81 kms Duration: 8-9 hours

#### Day 9 - Debring to Lato (4,014m) via Taglang La (5,328m)
Having learned the route's patterns, we anticipate thrilling descents after climbing mountain passes. Departing from Debring, our route to Lato via Taglang La—sitting at a remarkable 5,328m entails a challenging 22 km ascent. Thin air and steep inclines make the climb to Taglang La tough, but the downhill ride to Lato through Rumtse is relatively easier, remembering the precautions for downhill cycling.

The views from Taglang La are breathtaking, showcasing prominent peaks like Mt. Nun, Mt. Kun, and Kang Yatse. Descending towards Rumtse, the landscape changes dramatically with fewer scree and mountains boasting brick-red hues with traces of olive green—a unique sight in our expedition.

Lato, just beyond Rumtse, welcomes us to a homestay offering beds, blankets, and a hot lunch. We rest for the day, gearing up for our ride to Leh the following morning.
> Distance: 53 kms Duration: 5 hours

#### Day 10 - Lato (4,014m) to Leh (3,500m)
The day has arrived to journey to Leh! Though the distance might seem long, it's relatively manageable, mostly flat with a few ascents. The initial stretch amidst the striking red and green mountains is straightforward, albeit with occasional blind turns and roadwork.

Returning to civilization, our route passes through small towns and army bases toward Leh. The majestic Indus River accompanies us, leading us to Upshi. En route, we glimpse the renowned Thiksey Monastery, pausing briefly to admire its exterior. We also catch sight of Shey Palace before reaching Leh's city limits.
> Distance: 70 kms Duration: 6 hours

#### Day 11 - Leh (3,500m) to Khardung La (5,359m) to Leh (3,500m)
We now face the ultimate challenge of our expedition: ascending to Khardung La, the world's second-highest motorable road towering at 5,359m! This 45 km steep ascent to Khardung La poses an intense challenge, with a staggering height gain of 2000m. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is common here, emphasizing the need for continuous hydration and maintaining a steady cycling pace to prevent exhaustion.

At the top, a breathtaking panoramic view unfolds from the Indus Valley in the South to the vast peaks of the Zanskar range and the towering Saser Massif in the North. Khardung La top is often bustling with tourists seeking pictures at one of the world's highest motorable passes. Additionally, a small café and souvenir shop offer mementos to take home. We load our cycles onto the backup vehicle for the return journey to Leh, expecting to arrive by late evening. Though our trip concludes here, it's a momentous achievement worthy of celebration.
