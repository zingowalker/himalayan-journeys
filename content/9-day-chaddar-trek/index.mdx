Prioritizing Trekker Health: Acclimatization Guidelines for Zanskar River Trek
In light of the health challenges posed by Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), 
the Ladakh Government Authorities have instituted new regulations for Zanskar river trekkers. 
It is now mandatory for all participants to spend a minimum of three days in Leh, allowing their bodies to 
fully acclimatize to the prevailing weather conditions.

This crucial measure is non-negotiable and demands strict adherence from every trekker. 
Utilize the time in Leh wisely by exploring the local market and acclimating to the cold temperatures, 
a crucial preparation for the Zanskar river trek. 
The weather, reaching sub-zero even during daylight, necessitates gradual adjustment.

Exercise caution by avoiding visits to higher-altitude places during this acclimatization period. 
Additionally, it is strongly recommended to meticulously check and crosscheck all essential items before retiring for the night, 
ensuring a safe and prepared start to your Zanskar river trekking adventure.

#### Day 3 - Medical Check up

In compliance to UT Leh government guidelines, all trekkers are required to undergo a thorough medical checkup. 
Approval by the medical officer is a prerequisite for obtaining the green signal to embark on the Chadar the Frozen River trek. 
This comprehensive process ensures the well-being of each trekker and is a crucial step in the journey.

Upon successful clearance, trekkers will be furnished with wildlife permits, insurance coverage, and other essential documents. 
These documents play a vital role in ensuring a seamless and secure trekking experience through the frozen landscapes.
